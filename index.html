        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-businessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a full-time student at the University of California, Riverside. Usually most of my life is spent at school and at work as I am a teenager trying to become an adult. Despite that, I consider myself a person who meets her goals at any cost. If I set my mind to something it is very possible that I will strive until I achieve it. Without a doubt, I am a very responsible person in everything I do, normally I consider that I can be a punctual and organized person. I like to finish everything that I start, I do not leave anything halfway through and I always do it in the best way, because if not then I don't see the purpose of having done it. I am friendly with people and in general many times people approach me for a second opinion, so I infer that many people see me as a person they trust. I like to have routines and agendas that plan my day, which leads me to use time more effectively.
Throughout these years I have had the opportunity to be part of many jobs that have led me to acquire unique experience. In general, I have always worked more in customer service since I characterize myself for dealing effectively with people, plus personally I like to help people. I have experience in the kitchen industry since I have worked mostly in restaurants where we deal with pressure and speed at the same time, but I have also learned a lot about how to deal with people, suppliers, propaganda and so on. However, one of my best qualities is teamwork. I like to share what I know with others, in addition to providing a positive attitude to my team. It is important to collaborate and get to know each other as people in order to work together. More when I was working in large corporations like now, I worked in the school cafeteria where we deal with many students a day and we have to find a way to solve problems and work as a team at each station in order to survive the waves of people that come in the day.
<br><br>

      Likewise, I have qualities in the photographic industry since it is one of my greatest passions. I enjoy capturing family moments but I also have experience in product photography, portraits, and others. I have exercised this quality professionally but also as a hobby. Normally in High School I was one of the most outstanding photography students and chosen to do any photography section related to students and teachers. This is how I have developed leadership skills, since many times I was in charge of sections and activities related to that.
<br><br>

        Another of my characteristics is design, in many of the fields. I love designing pamphlets, advertisements, cards, etc. In my spare time I used to design t-shirts, and business cards for people that I knew. Many of them were happy with my work so I decided to take it more seriously and started exercising my design skills more so I have basic design knowledge.
